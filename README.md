# ü§ñ Transformer-Based Language Models (Input Talk @ Method Bits, MZES, UMannheim)
Welcome to the transformer-based Language Models (LM) talk! In this talk, we will explore the power of transformer-based LMs and how they can be used for various research tasks.

This is a talk on Transformer-based Language Models, covering a range of topics including what language models are, why we need a new architecture for them, the components that make the Transformer architecture so powerful, the differences between Transformer-based Language Models, how to train a state-of-the-art transformer model for various research tasks, and the limits and open challenges of these new types of Language Models.

_This workshop is designed to introduce participants to Transformer-based Language Models, including their architecture, components, and use cases. The workshop is intended for individuals who have some basic knowledge of machine learning and natural language processing._

### ü§ì Hands-on Sessions
This workshop includes three hands-on sessions using Google Colab:
* Supervised Topic Classification [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1K9zkPIUBPCWaVgg4duuYKirOrxAID0wG?usp=sharing): In this session, participants will learn how to train a supervised topic classification model using a pre-trained transformer-based language model.
* Domain Adaptation [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1K9zkPIUBPCWaVgg4duuYKirOrxAID0wG?usp=sharing): In this session, participants will learn how to fine-tune an existing language model to a specific domain by leveraging transfer learning techniques.
* Zero-Shot NLI Classification [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1K9zkPIUBPCWaVgg4duuYKirOrxAID0wG?usp=sharing): In this session, participants will learn how to use an existing transformer-based language model for zero-shot NLI classification.

### ü¶ú Limitations and Open Challenges
As with any technology, Transformer-based Language Models have limitations and open challenges that need to be addressed. Some of the current limitations and open challenges include:
* Ethical considerations around the use of large-scale language models
* Ensuring the models are robust and not easily fooled by adversarial attacks
* The need for more diverse and inclusive training data to reduce biases in the models
* Developing methods for more efficient training and inference with these large-scale models

### üìö Additional Resources
* HuggingFace Transformers Library
* "Attention is All You Need" paper by Vaswani et al. (2017)
* "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding" paper by Devlin et al. (2018)

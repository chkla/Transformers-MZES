# Transformer-Based Language Models Input Talk

This is a talk on Transformer-based Language Models, covering a range of topics including what language models are, why we need a new architecture for them, the components that make the Transformer architecture so powerful, the differences between Transformer-based Language Models, how to train a state-of-the-art transformer model for various research tasks, and the limits and open challenges of these new types of Language Models.

_This workshop is designed to introduce participants to Transformer-based Language Models, including their architecture, components, and use cases. The workshop is intended for individuals who have some basic knowledge of machine learning and natural language processing._

### Hands-on Sessions
This workshop includes two hands-on sessions using Google Colab:
* Supervised Topic Classification: In this session, participants will learn how to train a supervised topic classification model using a pre-trained transformer-based language model.
* Domain Adaptation: In this session, participants will learn how to fine-tune an existing language model to a specific domain by leveraging transfer learning techniques.
* Zero-Shot NLI Classification: In this session, participants will learn how to use an existing transformer-based language model for zero-shot NLI classification.

### Limitations and Open Challenges

As with any technology, Transformer-based Language Models have limitations and open challenges that need to be addressed. Some of the current limitations and open challenges include:

* Ethical considerations around the use of large-scale language models
* Ensuring the models are robust and not easily fooled by adversarial attacks
* The need for more diverse and inclusive training data to reduce biases in the models
* Developing methods for more efficient training and inference with these large-scale models
